# Marianne Williamson Policies

## Education
### If elected, I will work vigorously for the following:
* "Universal pre-school for all children."  
* "Increased funding for free and reduced-price lunches, so that they cover breakfasts as well... addressing hunger leads to addressing child poverty."
* "Federal compensation for state school funding, allowing equal access to quality education for every American child."
* "A far more expansive array of educational approaches, including social and emotional learning; the development of conflict resolution skills; restorative justice (schools who implement such programs have seen up to 65% reduction in violence and disorderly conduct); meditation and mindfulness; comparative religion (for the sake of spiritual enlightenment and to help ease religious strife); anti-bullying programs; and the fostering of other life skills to help prepare children for a meaningful life."
* "Teacher training programs and teacher retention. We must invest in teacher education programs that provide best practices and developmentally appropriate models of education for our future teachers. Retaining these teachers in our classrooms requires giving them adequate preparation, support, leadership, and autonomy as well as compensation that reflects their professional stature. We also need to ensure that teachers face classrooms of a manageable size – and that means hiring more teachers overall. Student/Teacher ratios must shrink."
* "Better management of education infrastructure. Buildings and buses are some of the largest budget items for public schools. There is no reason for buses to sit in a lot in between running kids to and from school, given society’s need for public transportation. Multi-purpose use for buses would improve communities and drive down school costs. The same can be said for school facilities – there are other community services that can be provided in those locations, safely and effectively."
* "Free college or technical school tuition for every qualified student. If we cannot find ideal offsets for this expense, I’m open to exploring ways that students can repay some of these costs with a small payroll tax once they start working (based on Oregon’s efforts) or through reasonable amounts of public service."
* "Student loan amnesty. We need to explore student loan forgiveness and options to remove red tape and lockouts, and reduce on-time payments from 10 years to 5 years. We need to reduce the interest rate for repayment of loans to a nominal, if not zero, percentage rate.  We need to eliminate the origination fee on federal student loans, and eliminate the annual caps on federally subsidized loans."
* "The most advanced matrix of technical schools in the world. Going to a liberal arts college is not the only option for higher education; we should create more opportunities for people who want to work in the trades or technical areas."
* "Low-cost education for those in middle and older age who have been dropped from our economy yet still retain, as all people do, the God-given potential to create meaning for themselves and others."

* "Radically reduce and, in some cases, outright forgive the debt of college loans."
* "Provide free higher education, including tuition at public colleges, community colleges and trade schools."

## Tax
* "Increase minimum wage to a rate that provides a living wage in its given geographical area - and set the rate to adjust for inflation from now on."
* "Make permanent the middle-class tax cuts, while repealing the corporate tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Bill."
* "Close the loopholes that give big breaks to big business, and ensure they pay their fair share of taxes to level the playing field so small business can compete."
* "Eliminate the income cap on payroll taxes."
* "Raise the estate tax (with special care given to help family businesses pay-off the estate tax bill over time so we don’t shut down small businesses)."
* "Eliminate the carried interest and ETF tax loopholes enjoyed by Wall Street."

## Healthcare
* "Require our healthcare system to reimburse medical professionals for a broader array of lifestyle and nutrition support, focused on preventing disease and/or addressing root causes."
* "Longer visits with doctors and/or their support staff to better equip patients with skills necessary to make lifestyle changes."
* "Provide patients with more robust ongoing support from nutritionists, health coaches, therapists and mental health, exercise specialists, and other peripheral lifestyle treatment providers."
* "Integrate world-class technology and systems for better collaboration and cost-savings among healthcare providers."
* "Fund programs in all our educational systems, pre-k through college, designed to teach nutrition and lifestyle skills to help cultivate long-term health."
* "Restrict the marketing of overly-processed and sugary foods to our children."
* "Stop subsidies for agricultural production of unhealthy foods, like high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated fats, and incentivize and subsidize farmers, ranchers and food companies for more healthy food production, making it more affordable and available."
* "Shape food policies using cutting-edge public health science instead of following the lead of lobbyists for industries whose sole focus is profit."
* "Secure and expand the role of the EPA and the FDA to keep toxins out of our environment and food supplies."
* "Take a national look at stress levels, and develop ways to lower stress societally. That means adding vacation time, protecting a manageable work week, and taking a close look at how our electronic devices impact our lives. Just as the FDA is supposed to make recommendations about how we eat, the FDA should study, and make constructive recommendations, on how we consume data from our phones and devices." 
* "We need to develop healthy habits at a community level. Towns and cities can, and should, look collectively at how active their populations are, and institute more ways to increase physical activity through walking paths, bike paths, and community events. The diet of entire cities should be reviewed, as well as ways that communities can contribute to one another’s daily health."
* "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should investigate how hospitals overcharge patients, and the Justice Department antitrust division should explore ways to remove as much of the profit motive out of medicine as we can."
* "The Center for Disease Control should invest more research into preventing disease, rather than treating symptoms and look broadly at vulnerabilities in the system (like avoiding pandemics by encouraging healthy disease avoidance behaviors)."
* "...find non-pharmacological ways to treat mental health issues, and to take all mental health issues as seriously as physical issues, and reduce the stigma of mental health illnesses, so that more will seek and receive treatment."
* "...treat drug addiction as a mental health issue, and not as illegal activity.  Only by de-criminalizing drugs can we break the back of cartels and drug dealers, while getting addicts into recovery."
