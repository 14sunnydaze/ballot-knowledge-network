## Our purpose

["Most have little or no confidence in political wisdom of the American people" according to Pew Research.](http://www.people-press.org/2018/04/26/the-public-the-political-system-and-american-democracy/overview_3-6/) In addition, ["Few say tone of political debate is ‘respectful.’"](http://www.people-press.org/2018/04/26/the-public-the-political-system-and-american-democracy/) The same study goes on to say that there are: ["Wide partisan gaps in views of some aspects of political system, criticism from both parties on others[.]"](http://www.people-press.org/2018/04/26/the-public-the-political-system-and-american-democracy/overview_6-4/) Martin Gillens and Benjamin I. Page of Princeton have also shown in their study that: ["When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy."](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf) The problem seems very difficult and perhaps some think impossible.

We at the Ballot Knowledge Network beg to differ! We are building a curriculum, training teachers and offering free one-on-one tutoring that is helping citizens make informed decisions in elections. We do all of this on a complete volunteer basis and any of our training can be received over Google Hangouts, Skype, Discord, Zoom or what you will.

## What are we working to include?

* Complete candidate coverage accross the political spectrum including third parties.
* Each candidate's position on every issue that is of relevance to the electorate
* Additional positions that the candidates are not taking on the same issues
* Evidence and justifications for and against each position
* Each candidate's voting record on related measures
* Campaign finance information about candidates
* Links to the sources of information
* Whatever people require to be sufficiently informed about the debate of an issue.

## Nonpartisanship, Inclusiveness and Consent

We expect volunteers to avoid sharing their personal political preferences. We expect volunteers to avoid attempts to impose their personal political and social positions while working together or teaching. We expect volunteers to be respectful to everyone. We do not tolerate social power dynamics. We expect volunteers to actively request consent rather than presume what their fellows want.
