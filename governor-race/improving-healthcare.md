# Improving Healthcare

## Jared Polis

### Positions:
#### Universal, Single-Payer Coverage for Western States
#### "Insurance creates the most value with the largest possible risk pool, so why
shouldn't all of us be in one risk pool to prevent gaming the system?"
#### "With states partnering in cost-sharing, development, and implementation, we
can provide coverage to more people at a lower cost and better quality of care
than a state implementing such a system would alone."
#### "Treating an illness or injury should never be a luxury afforded only to the
wealthy few who can afford it."
#### "Your income, location, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or
current state of health should never be a barrier to receiving affordable,
high-quality health care."
#### Without preventive healthcare, young poor people may have to face a life of
permanent poor health and cost taxpayers considerable amounts of money that
could have been avoided with less expensive preventative treatment.

## Walker Stapleton
### Positions:
#### "[I]mproving quality and reducing the costs of health care in Colorado by
working with a variety of groups and individuals to drive innovation, increase
transparency, and improve the delivery of care to make health care more
accessible.
#### "[A] government-run, single-payer health care program will result in higher
taxes and less choices. It will bankrupt Colorado and drive families and
businesses out of our state."
#### "I will defend patients with pre-existing conditions and continue to allow young adults under 26 to stay on their parentsâ€™ coverage."
#### "We must create more choice and access for families in the types of
coverage
they can purchase."

## Scott Helker

### Positions
#### "Our present issue with healthcare is the lack of competition. Because of
that, healthcare costs inflate at a 6% to 7% rate yearly. I propose a voluntary
statewide pool, including all state employees, where each individual can choose
their insurance policy. Included in this are the self-insured who can drive
competition within the healthcare system and start driving down prices."
