# Kirsten Gillibrand Policies

## General Policy Statements from Campaign Website

### Tax
* "We need to stop big corporations from making taxpayers subsidize astronomical paychecks for corporate officers."
* "We need to raise the minimum wage to $15 nationwide."
* "We need to rein in Wall Street risk and protect our financial system so unchecked greed can’t hurt families again." 
* "We should stop the transfer of massive generational wealth that exacerbates economic inequality."
* "We need to reverse the Trump tax plan’s massive corporate tax cut and make sure that wealthy Americans and companies pay their fair share in taxes."

### Healthcare
* "We need Medicare for All to make high-quality, universal, affordable health care a reality for everyone." 
* "We also need to crack down on greedy drug companies that raise prices to the point of being out of reach."

### Education
* "We need to allow graduates and their families to refinance their student loans at lower rates, unleashing billions into the economy."
* "We should make community college tuition-free."
* "We should work toward debt-free college by eliminating tuition and fees at public four-year colleges and universities for students from families that make up to $125,000 per year."
