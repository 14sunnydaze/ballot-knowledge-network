# Elizabeth Warren's Policy Proposals
## Cancellation of Student Loan Debt and Universal Free Public College
* ["I’m calling for something truly transformational: Universal free public college and cancellation of student loan debt" - Elizabeth Warren](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f?&subsource=GS-67138944213-elizabeth%20warren-p-344847569912&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnpXmBRDUARIsAEo71tS7r-Ol8h6KQyxt-vatrQfZH2OVxckVq9pzaQ7WNm7MxodPbPqkMMwaAhv7EALw_wcB&refcode=WFP2019-LB-GS-CO&refcode2=GS-67138944213-elizabeth%20warren-p-344847569912)
### Main Points
* Cancel $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with household income under $100,000.
* Provide substantial debt cancellation for every person with household income between $100,000 and $250,000. The $50,000 cancellation amount phases out by $1 for every $3 in income above $100,000, so, for example, a person with household income of $130,000 gets $40,000 in cancellation, while a person with household income of $160,000 gets $30,000 in cancellation.
* No debt cancellation to people with household income above $250,000 (the top 5%).
* Cancellation will take place automatically using data already available to the federal government about income and outstanding student loan debt.
* Private student loan debt is also eligible for cancellation, and the federal government will work with borrowers and the holders of this debt to provide relief.
* Canceled debt will not be taxed as income.
* Create a fund for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The fund will have a minimum of $50 billion, but the Secretary of Education will have the authority to increase the amount of money in the fund as needed to ensure that spending per-student at those schools is comparable to colleges in the area.
* Make additional federal funding available to states that demonstrate substantial improvement in enrollment and graduation rates for lower-income students and students of color.
* After an appropriate transition period, ban for-profit colleges from receiving any federal dollars (including military benefits and federal student loans), so they can no longer use taxpayer dollars to enrich themselves while targeting lower-income students, servicemembers, and students of color and leaving them saddled with debt.
* Require public colleges to complete an annual audit that identifies issues creating shortfalls in enrollment and graduation rates for lower-income students and students of color and that proposes steps to improve those rates.
* Prohibit public colleges from considering citizenship status or criminal history in admissions decisions.
* Fully cover the cost of these ideas with revenue from my Ultra-Millionaire Tax on the wealthiest 75,000 families in the country — those with fortunes of $50 million or more.

## Ultra-Millionaire Tax
* ["The richest top 0.1% has seen its share of American wealth nearly triple from 7% to 20% between the late 1970s and 2016, while the bottom 90% has seen its share of wealth decline from 35% to 25% in that same period." - Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/ultra-millionaire-tax/)
### Main Points
* families in the top 0.1% are projected to owe 3.2% of their wealth in federal, state, and local taxes this year, while the bottom 99% are projected to owe 7.2%
* The Ultra-Millionaire Tax taxes the wealth of the richest Americans.
* It applies only to households with a net worth of $50 million or more—roughly the wealthiest 75,000 households, or the top 0.1%. 
* Households would pay an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.
* This  tax on roughly 75,000 households will bring in aproximately $2.75 trillion in revenue over a ten-year period.
* All assets are included in the net worth calculation, which will produce more revenue and reduce opportunities for avoidance and evasion
* Taxpayers will be permitted to defer payment of the tax with interest for up to five years
* Valuing assets for the purposes of the Ultra-Millionaire Tax will provide an opportunity to tighten and expand upon existing valuation rules for the estate tax
* The proposal also includes strong anti-evasion measures, including but not limited to: a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget; a minimum audit rate for taxpayers subject to the Ultra-Millionaire Tax; a 40% “exit tax” on the net worth above $50 million of any U.S. citizen who renounces their citizenship; and systematic third-party reporting that builds on existing tax information exchange agreements adopted after the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.
