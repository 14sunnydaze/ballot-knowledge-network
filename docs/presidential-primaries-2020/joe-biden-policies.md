# Joe Biden's Policy Proposals
## Education
### Student Loan Debt
#### "Guaranteeing every American the skills and education they need to get ahead."
"Education is at the heart of the American Dream, and essential for the United States to compete globally in the decades to come. Every American should have the opportunity throughout their lives to obtain the skills and education to realize their full potential—starting long before they enter kindergarten, and all the way through a certificate program, on-the-job training, community college, or a four-year degree. And everyone should have the opportunity to update their skills as rapidly as the economy changes."

### Tax Policy

#### "Rewarding work, not just wealth."
"Economic inequality is pulling this country apart. We need stronger labor laws and a tax code that rewards a middle class that’s been cut out of decades of economic growth—not just the wealthy, who have gotten too many tax breaks for too long."
