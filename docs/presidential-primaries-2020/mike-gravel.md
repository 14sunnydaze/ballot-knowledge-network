# Mike Gravel's Policy Proposals 

## Fair Education Reform
* ### The United States should:
* Provide free, high-quality preschool education for all with direct funding to states.
* Delink property taxes and education funding, moving to a federal model for school funding in which all students receive an equal amount of funding.
* Promote the inclusion of climate science, sustainable development and universal human rights into school curricula.
* Make all public universities and graduate schools absolutely tuition free by providing funding directly to states.
* Announce a one-time “Student Debt Jubilee,” with all student debt held by the U.S. government being forgiven.
* Provide debt forgiveness, paid for by the government, of the first $25,000 of private student loan debt.

## Progressive Tax Reform 
* ### The United States should:
* Repatriate all wealth currently residing in off-shore tax havens and that are therefore avoiding taxation, with a one-time tax rate of 24 per cent.
* Institute a tax on all financial transactions – a Tobin spot tax – on all speculative financial transactions, including but not limited to foreign exchange trading.
* Marginal tax of all income over $1 million at 60 percent, incomes over $5 million at 70 percent, incomes over $10 million at 80 percent, and incomes over $20 million at 95 percent.
* Raise the capital gains tax.
* Eliminate all tax expenditures designed to benefit oil, gas, and coal companies.
* Explore a progressive tax on initial public offerings, to increase as the size of the IPO increases.
* Eliminate tax expenditures that benefit the wealthy.
* Cap tax expenditures for households making over $130,000 at $8,000 a year.

## Health as a Human Right
* ### The United States should:
* Draw on good practices in universal health care provision from around the world  in order to construct the best possible approach suited to the specific profiles and health care needs of the American population.
* Use resources freed up from the wasteful wars of choice, military overreach, and generated from revenues raised from progressive taxation of wealth and income, to offer a publicly-run and -financed national health service.
* With Medicare-for-All as a medium term transitional system, the ultimate aim is a “Veterans Administration-style healthcare for all,” or “VA4A” for short.
* Institute a single-payer system for all Americans and tax-paying permanent residents irrespective of income and employment status.
* Provide full coverage as is, to date, provided by private health insurers, including dental, vision, and hearing services.
* Retain private health insurance companies to provide ancillary health and social care services.
