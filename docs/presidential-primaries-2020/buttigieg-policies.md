* "I'm not as certain I'm comfortable with people of that high an income participating" in Warren's debt forgiveness plan," he said, "until we have completed the transition to a more progressive tax code."

* Would allow students to refinance student loans at lower interest rates.
* "He pointed out, though, that college graduates earn more than some of the non-college-graduates who would be taxed more to subsidize a free college scheme. He said he found that hard to square with his 'progressive' outlook."

## Tax Policy
* Higher tax rate for high income earners.
* "If we’re going to collect revenue from the middle class, then we have to be certain that it is going to be reinvested and returned to the middle class in a way that makes us and the middle class better off."

*  "I think we certainly need to consider a higher marginal tax rate for top income earners. Maybe it doesn’t have to be as high as it was historically, but we should at least admit that when it was higher, the American economy was growing pretty well. We should consider a wealth tax. I think it makes sense. I think one of the things that’s appealing about it is it’s not very distortionary compared to an income tax, and that’s important."
