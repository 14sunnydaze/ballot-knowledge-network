# Eric Swalwell Policies

## Healthcare
* "Americans need a healthcare guarantee: If you’re sick, you’ll be seen by a doctor, and if you’re seen, you’ll never go broke because of it. We also must make a huge public investment in finding cures in our lifetime for the diseases that ail us, from Alzheimer’s to ALS to cancer."

* Will not end private insurance: "I think people want to have choices, but a public option with support from the government for those who need it the most I think will put pressure on the private insurers and drive down the cost.”
