# Eric Swalwell Policies

## Healthcare
* "Americans need a healthcare guarantee: If you’re sick, you’ll be seen by a doctor, and if you’re seen, you’ll never go broke because of it. We also must make a huge public investment in finding cures in our lifetime for the diseases that ail us, from Alzheimer’s to ALS to cancer."

## Education
* "We need no-interest federal student loans, tax-free employer contributions, and debt-free college for public university students who do work-study and commit to bettering their communities after graduation."

## Taxes 
* Eric Swalwell's campaign website has no specific tax policy as of 5/16/19.
