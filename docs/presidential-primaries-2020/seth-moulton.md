# Seth Moulton Policies

## Healthcare
* "Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. All Americans deserve health insurance that’s affordable, that isn’t tied to a job, and that covers all pre-existing conditions—no matter who you are."
* "...we need a public option, which would give all Americans a choice between public healthcare and their current insurance. Doing so would create competition in the market, driving down prices and giving Americans what they deserve: lower prescription prices, cheaper premiums, coverage for pre-existing conditions, and better care."

## Education
* "Zip codes or skin color should never limit children’s potential or determine the quality of their schools. To fix our education system, we need to pay our teachers what they deserve, truly integrate our schools, and give all of our country’s kids a public education that prepares them for the new economy—regardless of where they live. And secondary education, whether it’s traditional college, community college, or vocational school, should be within reach for every kid in America."

## Tax
* "...today, 1% of Americans have more money than the bottom 50% of Americans combined. That’s unacceptable. Our tax system should help grow the middle class and small businesses."
