# Wayne Messam Policies

## Healthcare
* "Access to quality healthcare is one of the top barriers to economic opportunity, mobility and stability."
* "...we must re-evaluate our priorities and make healthcare a fundamental right — not a privilege — in this country. We must reform the system from the top down and drive down costs for patients, including giving the government more authority to negotiate prescription prices for seniors."

## Education
* "Teachers deserve a raise. Children deserve access to learning experiences that will unleash their potential. Parents deserve a chance to send their kids to great schools without having to pay millions of dollars under the table, like celebrities and the wealthiest Americans."
* "We must make smart investments in education, including teacher salaries that align with the importance of their work; the resources, supplies and training our educators need; and expanded opportunities for students pursuing career and technical training. Education is the great equalizer, and I will fight every day to make that a reality for every child regardless of zip code."

* "It is time for the federal government to cancel all federal and private student loans. This one-time policy would boost the annual GDP between $86 billion and $108 billion and create 1 million to 1.5 million new jobs each year."

## Tax
* "Instead of preparing us for the future, they have given millions in tax breaks to big corporations. When I’m President, repealing the Trump tax breaks for the wealthy will be at the top of my agenda."
